# Readings Loop

Purpose: capture external learnings and convert them into improvements for skills and workflow docs.

## Structure

- `inbox/` raw notes from latest readings/content consumed
- `syntheses/` distilled summaries and actionable takeaways
- `skill-deltas.md` proposed and accepted updates to skills
- `decision-log.md` accepted/rejected decisions with rationale

## Process

1. Capture new context in `inbox/`.
2. Distill key takeaways into `syntheses/`.
3. Propose changes in `skill-deltas.md`.
4. Record approval/rejection in `decision-log.md`.
5. Apply accepted updates to `skills/` and relevant docs.

## Naming Conventions

- Inbox notes: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
- Synthesis notes: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-synthesis.md`
