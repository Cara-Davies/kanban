# TDD Workflow Template

Use this template in new repos to keep implementation test-first.

## Red-Green-Refactor Checklist

- [ ] Red: add/adjust a test that fails for the intended behavior
- [ ] Green: implement the smallest change to make the test pass
- [ ] Refactor: improve code structure without changing behavior
- [ ] Verify: run full test suite and required quality checks

## Per-Task Evidence

Record this for each implemented task:

- Task ID:
- Failing test name(s):
- Passing test command:
- Additional checks:
- Notes:
